# Language Server VSCode Extension

This is pretty much a copy of the Tower LSP's example extension

I only modified it to support syntax highlighting of NTLC files via the `lsp-extension/syntaxes/ntlc.tmLanguage.json` file.

And adjusted it to start our Rust NTLC Language Server instead of the example one.
